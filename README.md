### Using the plugin

#### Reference a commit to a Kanboard task

- Choose action: **Create a comment from an external provider**
- Choose the event: **Gitea commit reference received** (or **Gitea commit close received**, see below)

Use the keyword `refs` followed by the taks-reference: `refs #1234`.

The comment will contain the commit message and the URL to the commit. If the email of the commit author matches a Kanboard user, the comment will be attached to this user.


#### Close and/or move a Kanboard task when a commit is pushed to Gitea

- Choose action: **Close the task**
- Choose the event: **Gitea commit close received**

When one or more commits are sent to Gitea, Kanboard will receive the information, each commit message with a task number included will be closed.

The plugin detects the follwing keywords followed by a task-reference: `closes`, `implements`, `fixes`, example: `closes #1234`

If the task should be moved to another column attach this event to **Move the task to another column when assigned to a user**. Please note that for this to work, the Kanboard task needs to be assigend to a user and live in the column defined during action setup.

If an additional comment should be created, you can also attach this event to **Create a comment from an external provider**
